# ETFBL_IP
## Overview
ETFBL_IP is a system developed for a fictional company that rents electric cars, bikes, and scooters. The system is implemented using Spring Boot for the backend, with a focus on user management, vehicle rental, maintenance tracking, and promotional activities.

The application also provides a user interface for employees (administrators, operators, and managers) to manage vehicles, users, maintenance issues, and rental statistics, as well as a separate client-side interface for renting vehicles and managing their profiles.
